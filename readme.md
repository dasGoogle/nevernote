# NeverNote - a very bad notes app

This node.js app is designed to show web security issues such as XSS and CSRF to students during a workshop at the [Sch√ºlerkongress 2020](https://sfn-kassel.de/informationen/schuelerkongress) of the [SFN Kassel](https://sfn-kassel.de). 

## Goals of the developed attacks
The goal of the attacks created during the workshop is to be able to delete all messages of a user without their will as well as transmitting all private notes to an attackers' server.
